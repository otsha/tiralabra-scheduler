## Architecture

The software follows a four-tier architecture. The top layer consists of the user interface, algorithm visualization and the application's startup functionality, which are located in packages ```ui``` and ```app``` respectively.

The application's main functionality - scheduling - happens at the logic layer, which the user interface calls when necessary. All logical functionality is located in the ```logic``` package.

The ```Task``` object and the custom data structures used by the application (```TaskList```, ```TaskQueue```) are located in the ```data``` package.

Finally, the bottom layer of the application consists of I/O classes inside the package ```access```. These are compiled together in the ```IOHandler``` class, which allows for simple initialization and access to inputs, outputs and permanent storage. Inputs are handled by ```Parser```, which can be used to read user inputs and to validate Task creation. Outputs are handled by ```Printer```, which has methods for operations such as printing out lines, colors and tables. The ```FileAccess``` class is responsible for reading and saving data to an external file. The data is stored in jSon format using the GSon library.

## Data Structures

The application implements two custom data structures.

### TaskList
```TaskList``` is an ArrayList-like data structure for storing tasks.

#### Methods offered by TaskList

- ```size()``` - Returns the number of tasks currently on the list
- ```capacity()``` - Returns the current capacity of the list
- ```add(Task t)``` - Adds a task on the list, doubling the capacity if the number of tasks is more than 1/2 of the current capacity
- ```remove(int index)``` - Removes a task from the given index, halving the capacity if the number of tasks is less than 1/2 of the current capacity
- ```get(int index)``` - Returns the task at the given index
- ```contains(Task t)``` - Checks whether the given task is on the list
- ```swap(int index1, int index2)``` - Swaps the contents of the given indexes

#### Time Complexity of TaskList

| size | capacity | add | remove | get | contains | swap |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| O(1) | O(1) | O(3n) => O(n) | O(n) | O(1) | O(n) | O(1) |

The TaskList's ***space complexity*** is O(2n) => O(n).

### TaskQueue
```TaskQueue``` is a PriorityQueue-like data structure implemented as a binary maximum heap. Priorities are calculated using a comparator given as a parameter.

#### Methods offered by TaskQueue

- ```add(Task t)``` - Adds the given task to the queue
- ```peek()``` - Returns the highest-priority task currently in the queue
- ```poll()``` - Returns and dequeues the highest-priority task in the queue, then restructures the heap if necessary

#### Time Complexity of TaskQueue

| add | peek | poll |
|-----|-----|-----|
| O(logn) | O(1) | O(logn) |

The TaskList's ***space complexity*** is O(n).

## Algorithms

The application implements two algorithms. Merge Sort is used to sort TaskLists to follow the Earliest Due Date and Shortest Processing Time heuristics, while minimizing the number of overdue tasks is implemented using the Moore-Hodgson Algorithm.

### Merge Sort

The Merge Sort algorithm used by the application is implemented with private methods inside the ```Scheduler``` class.

**Time Complexity:** *O(nlogn)*

**Space Complexity:** *O(n)*

### Moore-Hodgson

The Moore-Hodgson algorithm is implemented as a public method inside the ```Scheduler``` class.

#### How it works
- Sort the given list of tasks in the EDD order
- For each task on the list:
	- Add it to the TaskQueue
	- If the total number of hours required to complete every task already in the queue exceeds the number of working hours left to complete this task, **remove** the single most time consuming task from the queue (simply using ```poll()``` in this case)
- Finally, sort the tasks left in the queue again in the EDD order.

**Time Complexity:** EDD sort + Adding and removing each task from the queue + EDD sorting again = nlogn + n*(logn+logn) + nlogn = *O(nlogn)*

**Space Complexity:** PriorityQueue + Schedule TaskList = O(3n) => *O(n)*
